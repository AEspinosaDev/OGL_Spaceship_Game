 - This game runs on a handmade engine written entirely in C++ made by myseld and [Rogarsu2014](https://github.com/Rogarsu2014) some years ago.  

- It was a project for a subject focused on the learning of C++.

- It is a great example for students trying to learn the basics of C++. The code showcases the basics of the object oriented languages paradigm. 

- For the rendering part it uses a very basic part of Open GL. Without any interest in shading. As I said, it is specially focused on the usage of C++.
 
- The models are made by myself and also the fbx importer class.
